 * Observer Pattern - Interface for stamina recovery system

 * This interface defines the Observer component in the Observer Pattern
 * implementation for the stamina system. It allows different parts of the game
 * to be notified when a character's stamina changes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Observer Pattern enables loose coupling between the character (subject)
 * and the systems that need to know about stamina changes, such as:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>UI updates showing stamina bars</li>
 *   <li>Logging stamina changes</li>
 *   <li>Triggering events when stamina reaches certain levels</li>
 * </ul>
